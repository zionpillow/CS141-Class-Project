 * Final Project
 * 
 * This assignment is final class project involving four team members.
 * In this assignment, students are to create a small, yet interesting,
 * text-based game involving a grid of 81 squares in which the player
 * tries to find a briefcase in 1 of 9 different rooms while avoiding or
 * fighting existing ninjas in the grid. This assignment incorporates
 * all of the knowledge learned throughout the course.
